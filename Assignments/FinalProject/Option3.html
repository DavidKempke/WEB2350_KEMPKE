<p>Rules: Has you wagering highly valuable credits deciding if you can defeat the computer over nine rounds. However, you have some inside information! You know that the computer will choose each throw (rock, paper, and scissors) exactly three times each, you just don’t know exactly when. Bet your credits based on your faith in knowing the computer’s next throw. The catch is, if you tie against the computer on a throw, you must at least DOUBLE your next bet! Bet carefully and amass the largest bank possible. There are ten rounds possible. Min bet it alway 5.
