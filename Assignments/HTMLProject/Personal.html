        <h1>Lacrosse is my game!</h1>
        <p>Stepping onto the lacrosse field is like stepping into a different world. You forget your troubles behind and enbrace the love of the game. The sweet smell of fresh cut grass the sounds of a team talking. Lacrosse is where i go to forget the world and become a better team player. You learn to become a learder while following others.

    <div id="Tech">
        <h1>Bring on the tech!</h1>
        <p>Technology gives us the power to change the world. It gave us has to use math in ways we never thought possible. I changed the way we talk to each other. We can pick up our phones and talk to a friend on the other side of the world. I love technology because not only did it change the world i grew up in but it also gives me the power to change the world my children grow up in. With some brain power and the right code you can create anything you want.

    <div id="Family">
        <h1>Family is everything!</h1>
        <p>I grew up in a split family were my parenets lived 50 miles apart but that didnt stop us from being close. My mom and I always pushed me to do better things. She pushed me to study engineering and to join a team. Were as my dad only say me on weekends he still was a part of my life. He was my couch and my teacher. Those leasons about togetherness didnt stop there, I am now starting a family of my own. I married the love of my life and plan to start a wonderfal family with her.
